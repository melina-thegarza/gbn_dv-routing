Programming Assignment 2: Network Protocols Emulation
Name: Melina Garza Uni: mjg2290


## DESCRIPTION
    Implemented a program that simulates a node in a computer network. The program incorporates a Go-Back-N Protocol for ensuring reliable transmissions at the 
    Transport Layer and a Distance-Vector Routing Algorithm to achieve efficient routing at the Network Layer. As an independent node, the program emulates the 
    interaction between multiple nodes, enabling them to send packets to each other as if connected by links.
